Quick change bowden extruder for 1.75mm filament

I designed this extruder so I can quickly change filament. It is designed in 123D Design so anyone can modify it to how they see fit. It uses a Mk8 drive gear.

I have included picture Picture1.jpg and Picture2.jpg.

Assembly should be pretty easy. If not I am usually on #reprap on IRC.

The Extruder Body 1.75mm.stl and cam.stl will need to be printed with support to work. I am going to work on adding support to them to get a cleaned print.
